My challenge is to scale the micro-service to handle 10 M records while ensuring great user experience. \nUsing New Relic and stress testing with K6, I identified that this application's bottleneck was the database's long query time. \nTo redesign the database, I developed a PostgreSQL schema with two tables; a products table containing the product details, and a suggestions table with two foreign key references referncing the id from the products table. By implenenting indexing, I achieved an average query time of 30 ms. \nTo further improve the efficiency of this application, I explored the viability of using arrays in my PostgreSQL schema. The new schema is similar to the first but instead of having a suggestions column referencing the product ID, there would be an array of suggestion IDs. My rationale is that my original schema design with indexing would have a logarithmic lookup whereas this new design would have a constant lookup given that I would use a primary key to search for the suggestions array which contains the primary key of the recommended. Implementing this new design improved the micro-serviceâ€™s average query time by 87% from 30 ms to 4 ms, and its database storage size by 68%, from 8.8 GB to 2.8 GB. \nAfter optimizing the database, my bottleneck became the server. At high traffic, the server would be unable to keep up with the requests, which would result in high latency and error. To address this issue, I horizontally scaled the microservice to 5 AWS instances and implemented NGINX load balancing with a least connection configuration. Ultimately, I was able to reduce latency from 3000 ms to 150 ms at 5000 users per minute.`;

I had recently found a doppelganger of my dog online and I thought this would be a fun project to do to see if people can differentiate Joey from his doppelganger. \nThis game has two game modes: a single player mode and an online multiplayer mode. \nThe single player mode allows users to play through a quiz. For each question, the player is given 20 seconds to select an answer. The player is also given 3 lifelines: 50/50, skip and reset timer, which can each be used once during the game. After using the lifeline, the button will become disabled. When the game finishes, it will take you to a game over page. It fetches a the top 10 high scores from the database. If the player scores higher than the 10th highest score, it would prompt the player to enter his/her name and add the score to the high score database. In the case where score is equal, the high score ranking would be determined by least time taken to complete quiz. \nThe multiplayer mode utilizes WebSocket (Django Channels) to maintain real time connectivity between two devices. Player one initiates a game by pressing create room which triggers the server to generate and return a unique game code. Player two joins a room by pressing join room which prompts a text input. on Submit, the client sends the submitted code to the server which checks if code is valid and if the player two slot is open. If everything is valid, it prompts you to start the game. player one cannot start game until player two joins the game. \nOnce both players join a room, they are connected via WebSocket and a turn based game is initialized. The game starts with player one. After each player completes 5 questions, it will send an updated score to the server and trigger the other player's turn. This will repeat until 4 rounds are complete and a game over page will be triggered indicating which player won.";

Given empirical test data, I developed a program that utilized a machine learning concept known as regression analysis to reverse engineer the material constants via the gradient descent method. \nThis program calculates the parameters that best fit the data and returns a graph depicting empirical and best fit data.
